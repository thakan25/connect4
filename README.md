# connect4

This repo is about Connect 4 game. If you do not know anything about this game, check <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html">this</a>.

Here in this project I have tried to implement mainly three things -
<ol>
  <li>Two player game without any computer player</li>
   <li>Developed an AI player using a search algorithm called <strong>Minimax</strong></li>
   <li>Another AI player but with different decision making approach, that is <strong>Monte-Carlo Simulation</strong></li>
</ol>

Furthur I am working on improving the runtime for the Minimax Implementation using various possible <strong>pruning</strong> techniques.
